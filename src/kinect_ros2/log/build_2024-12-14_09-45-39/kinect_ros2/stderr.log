CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/jetson/ros2_ws/src/kinect_ros2/build/kinect_ros2/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/pericao/ros2_ws/src/kinect_ros2/build/kinect_ros2 where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/jetson/ros2_ws/src/kinect_ros2/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/pericao/ros2_ws/src/kinect_ros2/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
